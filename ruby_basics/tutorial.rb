# This program should give users a brief tutorial on using escape sequences in Ruby.
# Write some code that prints the following (without comment
#

puts 'When you include \t in a double-quoted string in Ruby, the output looks like this:'
puts "before\tafter"
puts 'When you include \n in a double-qouted string, the output looks like this:'
puts "before\nafter"

# The first "before"/"after" pair should have a single tab character between them, NOT space characters.
